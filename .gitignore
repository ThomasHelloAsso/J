# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

/nbproject

# Binary-blob that takes bandwidth
/web-client/tmp

# Jotky app id and app secret that keeps changing
web-client/config/initializers/jotky.rb

# Ignoring log because it will always produce different results
api/log/development.log
